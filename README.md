# Anything | #30NitesOfCode
This project is an open source initiative inspired by the event **30 nites of code**. The challenge is for those who aspire to code consistently for at least 30 consecutive days. The project is a basic website with a header and a hero section, with the ultimate goal being to create a full-functioning website with features, sections, and tasks contributed by other developers. Contributions can range from adding sections, to small tasks like images or text changes - it all depends on what the contributor wants to add!

## Contributing
### `For New Contributors`
If you're new to open-source projects or looking for a way to practice your coding skills, this is the project for you! Beginners are encouraged to contribute, and every modification, no matter how small, is a valuable addition.
### `For Experienced Contributors`
For seasoned developers, this is a platform to mentor others, contribute your unique ideas, and enhance this website with your expertise.

## Easy Entry Tasks
- Bug fixes ([`See current issues or create one`](https://github.com/beingsie/anything/issues))
- Documentation improvements
- Addition of comments for enhanced code readability
- Small feature additions (sections, styling, images etc.)

## Goals 
The main goal of this project is to provide a space where coders, irrespective of their skill level, can contribute, improve their coding skills, and collaborate to create a dynamic, fully functioning website.

Remember, the idea here is not just to contribute but also to learn, collaborate and improve. Happy coding!
